Give class notes based on tansript, don't skip any important detail. 
It should be explanatory. But please do align with the transcript. Don't create 
new features or remove features or use different names. If you find any difficulty in 
understanding anything ask me. Ofcourse this is autogenerated transcript so there will be errors,
 try to minimise them by following a logical flow. Do mention which files to change. If there is
 mentioning about documentaion add that too
